# TUI-Turn-Based-Game
## What Is It?
> This is a python terminal interface game that comes from the idea of a RPG i loved growing up Sonny, so I decided to try and build a similar concept whilst improving my Python knowledge. This works by utilising local save data to save progress and using object orientated programming to build such characters for the game to work. The game is a 1v1 battle game that works by allowing you to choose your moves whilst the game automatically plays as the enemy and chooses the moves.

## Lessons Learnt
> This project has taught me how to program using OOP and how to return automatic selections using a script, furthermore it has improved my knowledge of bug fixing as during development I ran into so many bugs and issues. I also learn't how to work with save data and list objects.

```python
No modules are needed for this project to work.

if game is bugged:
  delete data.txt
```
